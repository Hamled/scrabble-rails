# Scrabble Rails Livecode implementation

## Project Outline

1. Models
    1. `TileBag`
        1. `tiles` (String)
        1. `shake!` method (shuffles tiles)
    1. `Player`
        1. `has_many :turns`
        1. `name` (String)
        1. `tile_rack` (String)
        1. `draw_tiles!` method (takes TileBag, removes N tiles and adds to Tile Rack)
        1. `play!` method (takes word, removes each letter in word from Tile Rack, creates new Turn model then calls draw_tiles!, raises error if insufficient tiles)
    1. `Turn`
        1. `belongs_to :player`
        1. `word` (String)
        1. `score` (Integer, calculated from word)
1. Routes

    1. `/players`
        1. CRUD routes
